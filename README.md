# Code Practice & Algorithms

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various algorithmic challenges and a playground for exploring the syntax of different programming languages. It serves as a personal record of my progress in competitive programming and software development.

## Project Structure

- **`leetcode/`**: Solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Includes implementations in C++, Python, and C#.
- **`exercism/`**: Exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) tracks, focusing on mastering language-specific idioms (C++, C#, etc.).
- **`CoreConcepts/`** (Submodule): A dedicated repository for fundamental data structures and algorithmic patterns (DFS, BFS, Sliding Window, etc.).
- **`hackerrank/`** *(Coming Soon)*: Future home for HackerRank challenge solutions.

## Languages Used

- **C++**: High-performance algorithmic solutions.
- **C#**: Modern object-oriented implementations.
- **Python**: Scripting and rapid prototyping of algorithms.

## Core Concepts Submodule

The `CoreConcepts` folder is integrated as a **Git Submodule**. It contains deep dives into:
- Binary Tree Traversal
- Dynamic Programming
- Sliding Window & Two Pointers
- Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS)
- And more...

To clone the repository with submodules, use:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Krzysiek-Mistrz/code_practice_and_algorithms.git
```
If you've already cloned it:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
